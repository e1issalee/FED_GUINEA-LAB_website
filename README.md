# GUINEA+LAB
Welcome to GUINEA+LAB! We are a skincare brand to create a revolutionary experience that fuses effective skincare solutions with a touch of playful entertainment. Our project aims to redefine beauty routines, offering a curated collection of skincare essentials from renowned brands. The website revolves around a membership program where users earn "face masks" with every purchase – tokens that unlock a world of skincare adventures and exclusive perks. What sets us apart is our commitment to affordability without compromising quality. By collaborating with other esteemed skincare brands, we bring you their renowned products at a more accessible price point, ensuring that luxury skincare is within everyone's reach.

## Design Process
#### Pore Patrols - "Face Mask" symbol tokens
Our design process is centered on understanding the needs of our users and creating an intuitive, engaging platform. User Stories guide our design choices:
* As a first-time visitor, I want to easily navigate the website to discover the range of skincare essentials, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions.
* As a skincare enthusiast, I want to explore detailed product descriptions, so that I can choose products tailored to my specific skin needs.
* As a frequent shopper, I want to have a member account with the shop.
* As a member, I want to track my purchases, earn Pore Patrol tokens, and access exclusive perks, so that I can enhance my skincare routine with additional benefits.

As part of the design process, we have created wireframes to visualise and plan the user interface. Below, you will find links to wireframes created using Figma.
